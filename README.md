# Inspired by Milk Collection Center

<h3>This is an Individual project.</h3>

<h4>
This is a complete MERN Stack project, which is inspired by a village milk collection centre. For the front end, I utilized React JS and Next UI to design an attractive and user-friendly interface. I also employed Redux for front-end state management to ensure a smooth user experience.

In the backend, I utilized Node.js and Express.js to handle all backend operations and create APIs for front-end requests. To store the data, I used MongoDB and the Mongoose library. For user authentication and authorization, I implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and secured user passwords using Bcryptjs.

Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my proficiency in various technologies and tools, including React, Next UI, Chakra-UI, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, and Bcryptjs.

#### 1) Starting Server in deployment

    npm start

#### 1) Starting Server with nodemon on locahost

    npm run server

### Database: MongoDB

#### 1) Atlas

    in .env file provide MONGODB_URL with proper credentials
